# Week 7 â€” Solving CORS with a Load Balancer and Custom Domain

Week 7 was delivered together with Week 6. Check my [week6 journal](https://github.com/beiciliang/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/journal/week6.md) for details. Here I only attach screenshots as the proofs for my working application.

1. Created services for `backend-flask` and `frontend-react-js` under the `cruddur` cluster on ECS.

5. On CloudWatch, log events show no problems with the health check.

6. If I go to the api domain, health check returns a success, and RDS data of activities can be retrieved.

7. Start page of our domain presents as the following screenshot.
